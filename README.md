# dynamic-array-c
This repository was made for an exercice in Data Structures courses at Ajou University in 2022. The goal of the exercice was to implement a basic structure to represent an array of element. The array need to be able to grow and shrink.

## Folder-organisation

In the inc folder you will find the header for each files In the src folder you will find the implementation of all the function. I divided the project in two part, the first part is about the array. The second part is about the user's interface.

## How to use it

First you will need to build the project, the makefile is provided with the program, so you just need to enter the following command at the racine of the workspace folder: mingw32-make. Ok so now, you have build the project, (the makefile is setup to compile the program for debug mode) you can now run the program by running the following once again at the racine of the workspace folder : .\bin\main.

In the program, you will be able to use multiple commands. They will be presented to you by a menu when the program is running. 

## Warning

Please do not create the bin and obj folder. They will be created by the makefile. Plus do not touch to the created files inside those two folders.
